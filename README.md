☕ Day 16 – Coffee Machine (OOP Version)

100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refactor of the Day 15 Coffee Machine project.
The logic is now organized into classes and separate files, making the code cleaner, scalable, and closer to real-world applications.

🎯 Project Overview

The program simulates a coffee machine that:

Offers espresso, latte, and cappuccino

Checks resource availability

Processes coin payments

Calculates change

Updates machine resources

Runs continuously until turned off
